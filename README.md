# PictureThis
This is a group project created during a Mobile Development course

Background:
  I worked with my classmates Steven Ramos and Alex Contrerez to create this project. 
  I uploaded it to my GitHub in order to showcase it in my portfolio. 
  I will go through and add comment tags with each page to indicate who worked on which pages.

Project Discription:
  In this project the user will upload pictures to the app. When uploading they will give the file a name as well as fill in the Date/Time & Location metadata.
  The user should be able to add/remove tags to the page through the tag system. To add a tag swipe right, to remove swipe left.
  The user should be able to rate pictures. Swipe right to increase the rating and left to decrease the rating. 
  The user should be able to display pictures based on a variety of different sorting options. 
    These include: Rating, Tags, Date/Time, Location, and View All.
